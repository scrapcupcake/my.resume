            <p>Hello, I’m Hunter Hunnie Thomas, a transgender/non-binary person. I’m currently homeless and trying to get back to my roots of my working career, retail and website development, to get back on my feet.</p>

            <p>I’m currently trying to figure out how to get the ergonomics of my disability and computer use to mesh well again, and looking for retail work to fill the time when I can’t be hunched over a laptop to be a good salesperson for stuff I believe in again.</p>
